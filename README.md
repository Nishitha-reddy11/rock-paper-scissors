# 🎮 Rock Paper Scissors Game
A simple Python project where you can play **Rock, Paper, Scissors** against the computer.  
This was one of my first Python programs — I learned the logic from an online tutorial and customized it with my own changes. ✨

## 🧠 About the Project
This game lets the user pick **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**, and the computer randomly makes its choice.  
The program then compares both and displays the result — **Win**, **Lose**, or **Draw**.

## ⚙️ Features
✅ User vs Computer gameplay  
✅ Randomized computer moves  
✅ Displays result after each round  
✅ Option to replay multiple times  

## 💻 How to Run
1. Make sure **Python 3** is installed on your system.  
2. Download this repository or the `rock_paper_scissors.py` file.  
3. Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   python rock_paper_scissors.py
Follow the on-screen instructions and enjoy the game! 😄

## 🧩 What I Learned
- 📘 Python basics — loops, conditionals, and functions.
- 🎲 Using the random module.
- 🧠 Game logic and user input handling.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add score tracking.
- Create a GUI version using Tkinter.
- Add sound effects or animations.
